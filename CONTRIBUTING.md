# Contributing

All contributions are welcome and I will be extremely grateful if you make it. You can help `gocatgo` by contributing with code, new ideas, telling me better ways of doing X, or anything! If you want to contribute with code, there are some things that still needs to be implemented (see [#todo](#todo) at the end).

## Pull Requests

1. Fork the project.
2. Make your changes locally.
3. Commit and create a Pull Request. In the text, for now, just explain what you did and that's it.
4. After you've created it, just wait a little, I will review it and merge it if everything is alright.

## TODO

1. Store images (with limit size)
2. Change some options to get from environment variables
3. Ability to create a paste with password, and be able to delete it if you have the password
4. Improve return code and messages
5. Provide the go binary to see the shasum
6. Make a docker image
